    <h2>Abortion Access</h2>
    <p> Abortion access is a human right. While many people have different beliefs which affect their opinions on abortion and if people should get them, everyone should have a right to choose for themselves. Not only should people have a right to choose if they wnt to start a new life they would be solely responsible for but abortion is a staple in medicine from ectopic pregnancies to miscarrages abortions are needed to help keep the cycle of reproduction safe.
